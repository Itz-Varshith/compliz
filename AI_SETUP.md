# AI Assistant Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the AI-powered coding assistant feature in your application.

## Overview

The AI Assistant is a chatbot integrated into the code editor that can:

- Analyze your code and provide suggestions
- Help debug issues
- Explain concepts and algorithms
- Suggest optimizations
- Answer questions about the problem you're solving

## Prerequisites

- OpenAI API account
- OpenAI API key

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
4. Click "Create new secret key"
5. Copy the generated API key (you won't be able to see it again!)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of your project (next to `package.json`):

```bash
# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

**Important:** Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.

### 3. Alternative AI Providers

If you want to use a different AI provider (like Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, etc.), you can modify the API endpoint in:

- `src/app/api/ai-chat/route.js`

Simply replace the OpenAI API call with your preferred provider's API.

## Usage

### Activating the AI Assistant

1. Navigate to any problem solving page (`/solve/[id]`)
2. Look for the **AI** button with a sparkle icon (âœ¨) in the top toolbar
3. Click the button to open the AI chat panel

### Features

- **Code Context Awareness**: The AI can see your current code and the problem you're working on
- **Interactive Chat**: Ask questions naturally as if you're talking to a coding mentor
- **Quick Actions**: Use pre-defined prompts for common tasks
- **Resizable Panel**: Drag the divider to adjust the chat panel size

### Example Prompts

Try asking:

- "Can you explain this problem in simpler terms?"
- "What's wrong with my code?"
- "How can I optimize my solution?"
- "What data structure should I use here?"
- "Explain the time complexity of my approach"

## Cost Considerations

- OpenAI API usage is billed per token (input + output)
- GPT-3.5-turbo is cost-effective for most use cases
- Monitor your usage at [OpenAI Usage Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/usage)
- Consider setting up usage limits in your OpenAI account

## Troubleshooting

### "AI service not configured" error

- Make sure you've added `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your `.env.local` file
- Restart your development server after adding environment variables

### API errors

- Check if your API key is valid
- Verify you have credits in your OpenAI account
- Check the browser console and server logs for detailed error messages

### Chat not appearing

- Make sure you're on a problem solving page (`/solve/[id]`)
- Try refreshing the page
- Check the browser console for JavaScript errors

## Privacy & Security

- Code and conversations are sent to OpenAI for processing
- OpenAI's data usage policy applies
- Consider the sensitivity of your code before using the AI assistant
- For production use, implement rate limiting and user authentication

## Development Notes

### File Structure

- **UI Component**: `src/components/ai-chat.jsx`
- **API Route**: `src/app/api/ai-chat/route.js`
- **Integration**: `src/app/solve/[id]/page.jsx`

### Customization

You can customize the AI's behavior by modifying the system prompt in:

```javascript
// src/app/api/ai-chat/route.js
let systemPrompt = `You are an expert programming assistant...`;
```

## Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Check the server logs
3. Verify your API key is correct
4. Review OpenAI's [API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs)

**Note**: Remember to keep your API keys secure and never share them publicly!
